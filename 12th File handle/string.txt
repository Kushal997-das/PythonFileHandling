In physics, string theory is a theoretical frameworkin which the point-like particles of particle physics are replacedby one-dimensional objects called  strings. String theory describes howthese strings propagate through space and interactwith each other. ... Thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity.In physics, string theory is a theoretical frameworkin which the point-like particles of particle physics are replacedby one-dimensional objects called  strings.
